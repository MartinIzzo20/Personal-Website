<p> Great White Sharks can swim at over 60 kmph, and the shark from the movie Jaws is a great white. Jaws is an awesome movie. 5 stars.</p>
<h3> Blue Shark </h3>

<p> Blue Sharks, unlike most sharks, swim in groups. These groups are similar to wolf packs. 5 stars.</p>

<p> Tiger sharks are called that because of their stripes. It is said that their eyes can see into the future. I don't think that's true. 4 stars.</p>
